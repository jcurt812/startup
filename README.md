### Note for GitHub Assignment
This is a note that I pushed for the GitHub assignment on 20 January 2023.

### Note added from GitHub
This is another note added via GitHub then pulled down in my development environment.

### Notes from this Assignment
This assignment gave me a chance to practice merging conflicts in VS code. This also helped me gain some familiarity with pushing and pulling to and from GitHub.



## Startup Project Pitch
Every election season, tons of voters go to the polls and submit ballots. Most of them submit a ballot based on party politics -- they vote for all of the republicans or all of the democrats. Only 4% of voters in the last presidential election voted for a senator from the opposing policital party of their preferred presidential candidate. This is likely due (in part) to a lack of true political knowledge and education. Voters do not know what kinds of topics are important to the candidates. Voters are forced to form political opinions based off of campaign ads and debate speeches that target personal flaws of opponents. They never learn the candidate's real goals or values. The application I want to build will be a non-partisan political education tool. In terms of look and feel, it will be similar to prevailing social media applications. However, only verified politicians will be given access to make posts. There will be no commenting or sharing or liking. For the average American, they will only be able to read posts. This will create an environment in which political candidates can share their true views on topics that are important to voters, so that voters can be properly informed.
